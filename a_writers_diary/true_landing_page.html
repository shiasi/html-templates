                    <p>
                        Do <strong>NOT</strong> use long sentences. If you choose a long sentences your prospect mind
                        becomes tired. They don't remember more than 20 words per sentences. So keep it
                        <strong>SHORT</strong>. You want to present/sell something, Not writing scientific articles.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Be nice to reader EYE</h3>
                    <p>A paragraph can be a single sentences!</p>
                    <p>As long as there are white spaces the reading is much better. <strong>Remember</strong> You are
                        <strong>NOT</strong> writing scientific articles!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Use white spaces wisely. <strong>Spaces:</strong> The words spaces, the paragraph and sentence
                        spaces and graphical white spaces!
                    </p>

                        That's obvious, your product/service exist to serves your customer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You write about them by writing about the problem you solve.

                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="pic-container">
                        <img src="https://picsum.photos/1024/400" alt="Sky" class="img-full">
                        <span class="pic-centered">
                            A Picture Is Worth A Thousand Words!
                        </span>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Use graphics WISELY</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can add as much as graphics <strong>NEEDED</strong>, no more or less.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Graphics should serves two things:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>FLOW:</strong> graphics should follow the page's purpose (selling like product's
                            picture, signup, join, etc).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>DESIGN:</strong> graphics should follow the design you chose (make page prettier,
                            readability, etc).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Whatever graphic you want to put in the page, should follows the two rules above.
                    </p>
                    <p class="center">
                        <strong>REMEMBER YOU ARE PRESENTING ON A PURPOSE, NOT FOR FUN.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Be nice and friend with your reader/customer
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Again you are writing for people for customer, you are not writing a scientific article.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Think him/her as a friend, a dear friend. How would you speak to your friend?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also be nice and polite, like a very dear friend.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Write as you speak, not as you write! This means writing like everyday talk, like presenting,
                        not like writing a book.
                    </p>
                    <p>
